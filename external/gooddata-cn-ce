We introduce GoodData.CN Container Edition, which requires a license. Please let us know if you are interested in a Container Edition. Alternatively, you can explore other deployment options below.\n\n# Quick Reference\n\nMaintained by: [GoodData](https://gooddata.com)\n\n[Documentation and API reference](https://www.gooddata.com/developers/cloud-native/doc/)\n\nWhere to get help: the [GoodData Community forums](https://community.gooddata.com/), or the [GoodData Community Slack](https://www.gooddata.com/developers/#connect)\n\n# What is GoodData.CN Container Edition?\nGoodData.CN is a cloud-native analytics service you can deploy next to your data. Its Container Edition comes in an All-In-One image, and it is the recommended way to evaluate and develop with GoodData.\n\nGoodData.CN gives you a headless analytics service you can fully manage and control programmatically. You can connect to and query our analytics engine similarly to any other database engine. Our query language MAQL resolves table joins and group-bys in real time\n ([learn more about MAQL](https://university.gooddata.com/getting-started-with-maql-in-gooddatacn)). \n\nGoodData enforces an analytics data model with shared definitions of metrics. The metrics are context-aware, so one definition supports multiple calculations (think aggregations and filters as named functions you can pass as arguments). That gives you governed self-service analytics: Business users can explore data while using the same definitionsâ€“even if they work with different slices of data.\n\nMultitenant analytics is supported via the concept of analytics workspaces for different groups of users. You can inherit a workspace definition in another workspace with one API call.\n\nYou can integrate GoodData.CN with your data warehouse, user authentication system, version control system, alerting system, etc. \n\nGoodData.CN Container Edition works with: \n- AWS Redshift\n- Google BigQuery\n- PostgreSQL\n- Snowflake\n- Vertica\n- Dremio (beta)\n- Apache Drill (beta)\n\nThe image includes:\n- **Analytics engine**: Connects directly to your data and translates queries from MAQL to SQL in real time.\n- **Declarative objects**: Describe all objects within the analytical engine (dashboards, semantic data model, insights, measures, data filters, and more) in a fully accessible JSON-based configuration that can be managed, versioned, and deployed between environments with tools like GitHub or GitLab.\n- **API Layer**: Allows full control over the computation, semantic layer, and other metadata objects. It can be accessed and managed programmatically by user or external application through the REST-based endpoints.\n- **Visual tools**: Build dashboards and explore the data in a drag-and-drop interface. Use the data modeler to manage the logical data model and the mapping to your data source.\n- **GoodData.UI**: A JavaScript/React library deployed to your application source code. Easily consume analytical objects or create new visuals based on top of the measures layer sitting in the analytical engine.

See the list above for relevant tags you can use instead of `latest`.\n\nStarting a container requires approximately two minutes until it becomes fully initialised, and it logs a lot of information to standard output. When the log output contains the following message, the container is ready to use:\n\n```\n  /============= All services of GoodData.CN are ready ==============\\\n  |                                                                  |\n  | Navigate your browser to http://localhost:3000/                  |\n  |                                                                  |\n  | You can log in as user demo@example.com with password demo123    |\n  | To access API, use Bearer token YWRtaW46Ym9vdHN0cmFwOmFkbWluMTIz |\n  |                                                                  |\n  \\============= All services of GoodData.CN are ready ==============/\n```\n\nLog in using the following credentials of a demo user which is prepared in the GoodData.CN Container edition:\n\n- email: `demo@example.com`\n- password: `demo123`\n- token: `YWRtaW46Ym9vdHN0cmFwOmFkbWluMTIz`\n\n# Tags used in this registry\n\nWe are using the following tags in this registry to differentiate between standard and development releases of GoodData.CN Container Edition:\n\n* **Tag \"latest\"** This tag always directs to the newest standard release of GoodData.CN CE. Use this tag if you want to evaluate GoodData.CN as this version contains the latest features.\n* **Tags in semantic version format**  We use tags in semver format (major.minor.patch - e.g. 1.6.0) for standard versions of GoodData.CN CE.\n\n# License\n\nGoodData.CN Container Edition is licensed under the [GOODDATA.CN CONTAINER EDITION LICENSE AGREEMENT](https://support.gooddata.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500005499441) and its usage is governed by the [GoodData Privacy Policy](https://www.gooddata.com/privacy-policy). \n\nAdditionally, this product may include software provided by third parties, including software provided to you under an open-source license.
