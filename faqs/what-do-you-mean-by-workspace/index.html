<p>A workspace <strong>consists of everything a user group needs</strong> to distill data into insights: data, the users with access, data model, metrics, calculations, and dashboards.</p>
<p>The workspace is defined by <strong>data privacy requirements</strong> and a <strong>user group's needs</strong>. What that means is that users from one workspace can't access data, dashboards, and insights from another workspace—unless you give them the right to do so. They also can view only the metrics, dashboards, and insights relevant to them, and no others. How you define your workspaces <strong>depends only on the needs of your organization</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, if you are a retailer, then it might be useful for you to create a workspace for each business partner or brand whose products you sell.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the structure of workspaces <strong>benefits you</strong> in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>It enables you to easily <strong>scale, distribute, and manage</strong> data, dashboards, and insights between different types of end users.</li>
<li>You’re charged for a number of workspaces instead of a number of users. You can have <strong>as many as users you want without additional costs</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Workspaces represent a unique development structure, like no other, built and optimized by GoodData to facilitate <strong>efficient analytics scaling</strong> to organizations of any size.</p>
