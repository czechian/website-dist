<p>An embedded analytics software/platform <strong>integrates dashboards</strong>, insights, its parts, or even the whole analytics tooling <strong>into your business application</strong>. In other words, while the <strong>data</strong> is managed by an analytics software/platform, the <strong>dashboards</strong>, visualizations, and reports are placed directly within the business applicationâ€™s user interface.</p>
<p>What that means <strong>in practical terms</strong> is that you get dashboards and insights closer to your end users, who can explore those insights and dashboards more often as they do not need to learn how to use a foreign analytics platform. The end <strong>users only need to log into</strong> a business application that they already use.</p>
<p>Also, if your team is building a multitenant <strong>SaaS platform</strong> or application, you can employ a third-party embedded analytics software and use whitelabelling (i.e. branding) to <strong>save yourself time and resources</strong>. Instead of developing and maintaining a complex data analytics platform, you can focus on what you are best at: developing and selling your core products and services.</p>
<p>Typically, embedded analytics is <strong>essential</strong> to SaaS platforms, web portals, data products, and applications that cater to B2B customers, distributed internal teams, partners or customers, and tech consumer markets.</p>
