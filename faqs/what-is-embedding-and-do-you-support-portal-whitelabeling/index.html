<p>An embedded analytics software/platform integrates dashboards, insights, its parts, or even the whole analytics tooling into your business application. In other words, while the data is managed by an analytics software/platform, the dashboards, visualizations, and reports are placed directly within the business applicationâ€™s user interface.</p>
<p>In practical terms, you get dashboards and insights closer to your end users, who can explore those insights and dashboards more often as they do not need to learn how to use a foreign analytics platform. The end users only need to log into a business application they already use.</p>
<p>Additionally, should your team build a multi-tenant SaaS platform or application, you can employ a third-party embedded analytics software and use white-labeling (i.e., branding) to save time and resources. Instead of developing and maintaining a complex data analytics platform, you can focus on developing and selling your core products and services.</p>
<p>Typically, embedded analytics is essential to SaaS platforms, web portals, data products, and applications that cater to B2B customers, distributed internal teams, partners or customers, and tech consumer markets.</p>
