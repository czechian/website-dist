<p>Multitenancy, also known as multi-tenant architecture, refers to a software architecture in which one single instance of software can serve different users. These users are also known as tenants, and each tenant accessing the same instance has clearly defined permissions.
Multitenancy gives the ability to deliver one application to many tenants, allowing them to access only relevant data through a single deployment.
Tenants can be individual users or groups of users, inside or outside the organization, who are somehow related to the business. Each tenant shares access to the environment, user management, configuration, and functionality of the application. GoodData implements multitenancy through the concept of workspaces.</p>
<p>A workspace consists of everything a user group needs to distill data into insights: data, the users with access, data model, metrics, calculations, and dashboards.
The workspace is defined by data privacy requirements and a user group's needs. This means that users from one workspace can't access data, dashboards, and insights from another workspace—unless you give them the right to do so. Additionally, they only view the metrics, dashboards, and insights relevant to them. How you define your workspaces depends only on the needs of your organization.</p>
<p>A workspace hierarchy in a multi-tenant environment defines how entities of a particular tenant (parent workspace) can be shared with other tenants (child workspaces) in read-only mode. The child workspaces use the parent workspace’s logical data model (LDM), analytical model, connected data sources, and other system setup requirements Once the parent workspace gets a new entity, it becomes available to its child workspaces.</p>
<p>Child workspaces inherit entities from their parent workspace and the parent workspace  from the root workspace. The root workspace is the top-level workspace in the hierarchy and does not have a parent workspace. You can have as many root workspaces as you need.</p>
