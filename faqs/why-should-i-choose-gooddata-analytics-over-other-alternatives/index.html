<p>The GoodData one-to-many platform is unique in the market for specializing in <strong>two vital capabilities</strong> of modern and <strong>future-proof analytics</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Efficient analytics scaling</strong>: Everything around the GoodData analytics platform is built to enable organizations to scale and manage their analytics efficiently in terms of cost and time. Our customers are therefore charged per workspace and not per user, and moreover, the structure of workspaces itself facilitates the control over hundreds of end users and dashboards.</li>
<li><strong>Embedded analytics</strong>: You’re able to integrate dashboards and insights into any business application that your end users (be it your teams, partners, or customers) like to use or that you would like them to use.</li>
</ol>
<p>All this comes with <strong>interactive and attractive dashboards</strong> and a <strong>self-service interface</strong> where end users can create their own dashboards by simply dragging and dropping.</p>
<p><strong>On top of that</strong>, the GoodData platform sits on structures that are able to crunch <strong>any volume</strong> of reports and data loads our customers request us to (just don’t be shy, just ask!). Lastly, when our customers’ data is not yet ready for scaling and big data analytics, our experienced data engineers step it up with their data transformation magic.</p>
<p>It's a <strong>powerful match</strong> for global, distributed organizations; ISVs (independent software vendors); and for SaaS applications that require embedding and scaling analytics, regardless of whether the analytics software is needed in the context of <strong>big data, business intelligence, or data visualization</strong>.</p>
