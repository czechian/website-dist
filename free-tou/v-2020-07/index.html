Customer against GoodData or its licensors exist relating to the
Subscription Services, You will require your Customer to exhaust all
claims against You before bringing such suit against GoodData.  You
shall use best efforts to cooperate with GoodData to enforce all such
limitations, restrictions and protections with respect to Your
Customers. If You offer terms to Your Customers that create greater
liability than the liability assumed by GoodData under this Agreement

with GoodData for such terms and that you shall indemnify GoodData for
such excess liability.  You hereby agree not to provide Your Customers
with any terms that permit Your Customers to enforce this Agreement

<br>
(b)  <strong>Restrictions</strong>. You will not make any representations or
warranties regarding the GoodData Technology and Subscription Services
beyond those contained in this Agreement or published materials made
available to You as part of the Program. You shall not engage in, and
shall contractually restrict each Customer from engaging in: (A) sending

containing malware or any other harmful computer code, files, scripts,
agents or programs; (C) interfering with or disrupting the integrity or
performance of the Subscription Services or the data contained therein,
or unreasonably burdens the infrastructure utilized by GoodData to
deliver the Subscription Services.<br>
<br>
(c)  <strong>Access; Security</strong>. You are responsible for all activities
conducted under all login credentials assigned to or created by You and
Your personnel, including as a result of any sharing of login
credentials, or failure to adequately safeguard login credentials. You
shall not (i) permit the concurrent use of a single login credential, or
time-sharing of the GoodData Technology; (ii) attempt to circumvent the
authentication required to access the GoodData Technology or other
security measures of the GoodData Technology, or (iii) authorize or
permit any person or entity to do any of the foregoing.<br>
<br>
(d)  <strong>No Personal Information</strong>. You expressly acknowledge and agree
that You and Your Customers shall not submit to or process via the
Subscription Services, and GoodData shall neither accept nor have any
liability to You or Your Customers for, any data that is Personal
Information (as defined below) or any Protected Health Information
subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
(“HIPAA”) (where “<strong>Protected Health Information</strong>” or “<strong>PHI</strong>” has the
meaning set forth in HIPAA), unless and until You purchase the GoodData
platform and services package intended for the processing and
distribution of such data. As used herein, “Personal Information” means
personal information as defined under applicable regulation, including
the EU General Data Protection Regulation or California Consumer Privacy
Act.<br>
<br>
(e)  <strong>Suspension</strong>. GoodData may immediately and upon notice suspend
all or portion of Your or Your Customer’s access to the Subscription

Your Customer has breached the restrictions in this Section 5.</p>
<p><strong>6. Confidential Information.</strong></p>
<p>​(a)  <strong>Confidential Information Defined</strong>. As used herein,
“Confidential Information” means non-public information provided under
this Agreement that the party disclosing the information designates at
the time of disclosure as being confidential, or, if disclosed orally or
visually, is identified as such prior to disclosure, or which, under the
circumstances surrounding the disclosure, the receiving party knows or
has reason to know should be treated as confidential without the need to
be marked as such.  Without limiting the foregoing, Confidential
Information shall include any information regarding a party’s financial
condition, business opportunities, plans for development of future
products, unreleased versions of products, know-how, technology,
Customer information, and Customer data.  The GoodData Technology and
GoodData Subscription Services shall be deemed GoodData Confidential
Information.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing received by a
receiving party shall be construed as Confidential Information which:
(i) is generally available to the public without breach of this
Agreement; (ii) is lawfully obtained from a third party without a duty
of confidentiality; (iii) is known to the receiving party prior to such
disclosure; or (iv) is, at any time, developed by the receiving party
independent of any such disclosure(s) from the disclosing party and the
receiving party can reasonably show such independence.</p>
<p>​(b)  <strong>Non-Disclosure</strong>. The receiving party shall not disclose the
disclosing party’s Confidential Information to any third party and may
only use the disclosing party’s Confidential Information for performing
and exercising its rights under this Agreement.  Both parties shall
protect Confidential Information from disclosure or misuse by using the
same degree of care as for their own confidential information of like
importance, but shall at least use reasonable care.  Further, both
parties agree to have each of their employees or independent contractors
with access to any Confidential Information agree to be bound by an
enforceable agreement that provides for the protection of the
Confidential Information from any unauthorized use or disclosure to at
least the same extent as does this Agreement.  Each receiving party
agrees to promptly notify the disclosing party upon learning of any
unauthorized disclosure of the disclosing party’s Confidential
Information, and shall provide reasonable assistance to the disclosing
party to remedy and contain such breach.  In connection therewith, You
agree to provide any such notice to GoodData at security@gooddata.com.
The foregoing notwithstanding, a receiving party may disclose the other
party’s Confidential Information if the information is required by law
to be disclosed in response to a valid order of a court of competent
jurisdiction or authorized government agency, provided that the
receiving party must give the disclosing party prompt written notice and
obtain or allow for a reasonable effort by the disclosing party to
obtain a protective order prior to disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>7. Security; Transmission.</strong></p>
<p>​(a)  <strong>Security Procedures</strong>. Subject to 5(c) above, GoodData shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain administrative, physical,
and technical safeguards reasonably designed for the protection of the
security, confidentiality and integrity of Customer Data as processed by
the Subscription Services, taking into consideration GoodData’s size,
resources and nature and scope of its activities.</p>
<p>​(b)  <strong>Responsibility for Transmitted Data</strong>. You acknowledge and agree
that the Customer Data will be subject to transmission over the
Internet, and over various networks, only part of which may be owned
and/or operated by GoodData, and that GoodData shall not be held
responsible for such transmissions or any Customer Data which is lost,
altered, intercepted or stored without authorization during  such
transmission.</p>
<p><strong>8. Fees and Payment.</strong></p>
<p>​(a)  <strong>Taxes</strong>. You will be responsible for and will indemnify and hold
GoodData harmless against all international, federal, state and local
taxes of any government, including, but not limited to, sales and use
tax (exclusive of taxes on GoodData’s net income), duties and
assessments arising on or measured by amounts payable to GoodData or
arising on or measured by amounts sold by You. If any applicable law
requires You to withhold amounts from any payments to GoodData: (a) You
shall effect such withholding, remit such amounts to the appropriate
authorities and promptly furnish GoodData with tax receipts evidencing
the payments of such amounts; and (b) in the event GoodData is required
to remit the withholding, GoodData shall make such payment, and the sum
payable by You upon which the deduction or withholding is based shall be
increased to the extent required such that GoodData receives the gross
amount owed by You notwithstanding such withholding.</p>
<p>​(b)  <strong>Currency Control</strong>. You represent and warrant that, as of the
Effective Date of this Agreement, no currency control laws applicable in
countries other than the United States where You conduct the activities
under the Agreement prevent the payment to GoodData of any sums due
under this Agreement.  If any such laws come into effect and the local
government of the Territory does not permit that payment be made in
United States Dollars, You will notify GoodData immediately, and if so
instructed by GoodData, deposit all monies due GoodData to the account
of GoodData in a local bank of GoodData’s choice in the affected
country.</p>
<p><strong>9. Indemnification.</strong></p>
<p>You shall:  (i) defend and hold harmless GoodData against any claim,
action, suit or proceeding (each, a “<strong>Claim</strong>”) brought by a third
party (including your Customers) to the extent that it is based upon a
claim related to: (A) the transfer of Customer Data and its processing
and use by GoodData as contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise
arising out of use of Your Customer Data in connection with the
Subscription Services, (B) Your branded service offering, (C) Your
Customer’s use of the Subscription Services (D) Your distribution of the
Subscription Services, or (E) other materials supplied by You or Your
Customers for use alongside the Subscription Services (including,
without limitation, any product related documentation that is not
GoodData Technology); and (ii) indemnify GoodData from any resulting
liabilities, losses, damages, fines, penalties, judgments, settlement
amounts, costs and expenses incurred by GoodData in connection with such
Claim(s), provided that GoodData (AA) promptly provides You with notice
of such claim; (BB) allows You control over the defense thereof and
related settlement negotiations; and (CC) reasonably cooperates in
response to Your requests for assistance.  GoodData may not settle or
compromise such a claim without Your prior written consent.  GoodData
has no indemnity obligations to You.</p>

GOODDATA FREE PACKAGE TERMS OF USE (“<strong>Agreement</strong>”) by and between You
(hereinafter referred to as, “<strong>Customer</strong>”, “<strong>Data Exporter</strong>” or
“<strong>Controller</strong>”) and GoodData Corporation (referred to hereafter as
“<strong>GoodData</strong>”, “<strong>Processor</strong>” or “<strong>Importer</strong>”) (each, a “<strong>Party</strong>”
and together, the “<strong>Parties</strong>”) and is subject to and governed by the
Agreement. In the event of any conflict between this Addendum and any
data processing terms contained in the Agreement between the
organizations hereto, the terms of this Addendum regarding the transfer
of personal data shall control and supersede the terms set forth in the
original Agreement.  Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein
shall have the meaning set forth in the Agreement, the GDPR, or the
CCPA, as applicable.</p>
<p><strong>1. DEFINITIONS</strong>. All capitalized terms used in this Addendum shall
have the meanings given to them below:</p>
<p>1.1  <strong>Applicable Data Protection Law</strong>: means all applicable
international, federal, national and state privacy and data protection
laws that apply to the processing of Personal Data that is the subject
matter of the Agreement (including, where applicable, European Data
Protection Law and the CCPA).</p>
<p>1.2  <strong>CCPA</strong>: CCPA: the terms and conditions relating to compliance
with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, Cal. Civil Code §
1798.100 et seq.</p>
<p>1.3  <strong>Controller</strong>: means the entity that determines the purposes and
means of the processing of Personal Data, and for the purposes of this
Agreement means Customer.</p>
<p>1.4  <strong>European Data Protection Law</strong>: means the EU General Data
Protection Regulation 2016/679 (&quot;GDPR&quot;) and any applicable national laws
made under the GDPR.</p>
<p>1.5  <strong>Personal Data</strong>: means any information relating to an identified
or identifiable natural person; an identifiable natural person is one
who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by
reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number,
location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific
to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or
social identity of that natural person.</p>
<p>1.6  <strong>Processor</strong>: means an entity that processes Personal Data on
behalf of the Controller or its subscribers.</p>
<p>1.7  <strong>Standard Contractual Clauses</strong>: means the standard contractual
clauses for the transfer of personal data to processors established in
third countries, pursuant to the European Commission Decision
C(2010)593, as attached at Annex A.</p>
<p><strong>2. DATA PROTECTION</strong></p>
<p>2.1  <em>Relationship of the Parties</em>: As between the Parties, Customer is
the Controller and appoints GoodData as a Processor to process the
Personal Data described in Appendix 1 to Annex A (the &quot;<strong>Data</strong>&quot;).</p>
<p>2.2  <em>Purpose limitation</em>: GoodData shall process the Data as a
Processor only for the purposes described in Appendix 1 to Annex A, and
strictly in accordance with the documented instructions of Customer (the
&quot;<strong>Permitted Purpose</strong>&quot;).  In no event shall GoodData process the Data
for its own purposes or those of any third party. Customer agrees and
acknowledges that Customer will confer with GoodData and will obtain
GoodData’s prior written consent before Customer loads any Data deemed
to be included in “<strong>Special Categories of Personal Data</strong>” under GDPR
(e.g. data consisting of racial or ethnic origin, political opinions,
religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic
data, biometric data, data concerning health or data concerning a
natural person's sex life or sexual orientation) onto GoodData’s data
processing platform.</p>
<p>2.3  <em>International transfers of Data</em>: GoodData will at all times
provide an adequate level of protection for the Data, wherever
processed, in accordance with the requirements of Applicable Data
Protection Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
GoodData shall not process or transfer any Data originating from the
European Economic Area (EEA) in or to a territory which has not been
designated by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of
data protection or a territory that is not subject to a bilateral
arrangement such as the EU-US Privacy Shield that provides a legal basis
for Data transfers based on GoodData’s adherence to applicable Privacy
Shield principles unless: (i) it has first obtained Customer's prior
written consent; and (ii) it executes and complies with its obligations
under the Standard Contractual Clauses attached at Annex A (including
its Appendices), which shall form an integral part of this Agreement. In
the event of any conflict between the Standard Contractual Clauses and
this Agreement, the Standard Contractual Clauses shall control and
supersede.</p>
<p>2.4  <em>Confidentiality of processing</em>: GoodData shall keep strictly
confidential all Personal Data that it processes on behalf of Customer.
GoodData shall ensure that any person that it authorises to process the
Data (including GoodData's staff, agents and subcontractors) (an
&quot;<strong>Authorised Person</strong>&quot;) shall be subject to a strict duty of
confidentiality (whether a contractual duty or a statutory duty), and
shall not permit any person to process the Data who is not under such a
duty of confidentiality. GoodData shall ensure that only Authorised
Persons will have access to, and process, the Data, and that such access
and processing shall be limited to the extent strictly necessary to
achieve the Permitted Purpose.  GoodData accepts responsibility for any
breach of this Agreement caused by the act, error or omission of an
Authorised Person.</p>
<p>2.5  <em>Prohibition on Selling Information of California residents</em>: For
avoidance of doubt, GoodData is a Service Provider and not a Third Party
as described in the CCPA.  Therefore, GoodData shall not: (i) sell the
Personal Information, (ii)  retain, use, or disclose the Personal
Information for any purpose other than providing the services specified
in the Agreement or for a Business Purpose. Specifically, GoodData shall
not retain, use, or disclose the Personal Information for a Commercial
Purpose, or (iii)  retain, use, or disclose the Personal Information
outside of the direct business relationship between GoodData and
Company.  Notwithstanding anything in the Addendum or any related order
form or other document, the parties acknowledge and agree that Company’s
provision of access to Personal Information is not part of and
explicitly excluded from the exchange of consideration, or any other
thing of value, between the parties. (Capitalized terms used in this
Section 2.5 shall have the meaning set forth in the CCPA.)</p>
<p>2.6  <em>Security</em>: GoodData shall implement appropriate technical and
organisational measures to protect the Data from (i) accidental or
unlawful destruction, and (ii) loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure
of, or access to the Data (a &quot;Security Incident&quot;).  At a minimum, such
measures shall include the security measures identified in Appendix 2 to
Annex A, and as further described in the Documentation to the Agreement.</p>
<p>2.7  <em>Subcontracting</em>: GoodData shall not subcontract any processing of
the Data to a third party sub-Processor without the prior written
consent of Customer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer consents to
GoodData engaging third party sub-Processors to process the Data listed
at
<a href="https://www.gooddata.com/legal/#subprocessors">https://www.gooddata.com/subprocessors</a>.
If Customer objects to GoodData's appointment of a new third party
sub-Processor on reasonable grounds relating to the protection of the
Data, then either GoodData will not appoint the sub-Processor or the
parties will promptly confer and discuss alternative arrangements to
enable GoodData to continued processing of Data. In all cases, GoodData
shall impose the same data protection terms on any sub-Processor it
appoints as those provided for by this Agreement and GoodData shall
remain fully liable for any breach of this Agreement that is caused by
an act, error or omission of its sub-Processor.</p>
<p>2.8  <em>Cooperation and Individuals' rights</em>: To extent Customer is unable
to directly respond to a privacy inquiry made by a data subject itself,
GoodData shall then provide all reasonable and timely assistance to
Customer to enable Customer to respond to: (i) any request from an
individual to exercise any of its rights under Applicable Data
Protection Law; and (ii) any other correspondence, enquiry or complaint
received from an individual, regulator, court or other third party in
connection with the processing of the Data.  In the event that any such
communication is made directly to GoodData, GoodData shall promptly
inform Customer providing full details of the same and shall not respond
to the communication unless specifically required by law or authorized
by Customer.</p>
<p>2.9  <em>Data Protection Impact Assessment</em>: If GoodData believes or
becomes aware that its processing of the Data is likely to result in a
high risk to the data protection rights and freedoms of individuals, it
shall promptly inform Customer of the same. GoodData shall provide
Customer with all such reasonable and timely assistance as Customer may
require in order to conduct a data protection impact assessment, and, if
necessary, to consult with its relevant data protection authority.</p>
<p>2.10  <em>Security Incidents</em>: Upon becoming aware of a Security Incident,
GoodData shall inform Customer without undue delay (and, in any event,
within five (5) business day unless otherwise required sooner under
applicable laws) and shall provide all such timely information and
cooperation as Customer may reasonably require in order for Customer to
fulfil its data breach reporting obligations under (and in accordance
with the timescales required by) Applicable Data Protection Law and
relevant contractual obligations owed by Customer to its users and
subscribers.  GoodData shall further take all such measures and actions
as are necessary to remedy or mitigate the effects of the Security
Incident and shall keep Customer informed of all developments in
connection with the Security Incident.  GoodData shall not notify any
third parties of a Security Incident affecting the Data unless and to
the extent that: (a) Customer has agreed to such notification, and/or
(b) notification is required to be made by GoodData under Applicable
Data Protection Laws.</p>
<p>2.11 <em>Deletion or return of Data</em>: Upon termination or expiry of the
Agreement, GoodData shall (at Customer's election) destroy or enable
Customer to retrieve all Data (including all copies of the Data) in its
possession or control (including any Data subcontracted to a third party
for processing).  Unless agreed to otherwise in the underlying agreement
between the Parties, GoodData shall enable Customer to retrieve
Customer’s Data within thirty (30) days of Customer’s request. GoodData
shall delete all Data within the GoodData platform within thirty (30)
days of the termination of this Addendum or the Agreement, or upon
Customer’s written request.  This requirement shall not apply to the
extent that GoodData is required by applicable law to retain some or all
of the Data, in which event GoodData shall isolate and protect the Data
from any further processing except to the extent required by such law.</p>
<p>2.12 <em>Compliance Assessments</em>: No more than once per year, solely for
the purpose of meeting its audit requirements under Article 28, section
3(h) of the GDPR or its obligations under 5(f) and 12(2) of the Standard
Contract Clauses, Customer may request an audit in writing.  GoodData
shall then permit Customer (or its appointed third-party auditors) to
review GoodData’s SOC-2, Type II or similar audit report and relevant
security and compliance documentation, including but not limited to
self-assessment questionnaires and security testing results. GoodData
shall also respond to any written audit questions submitted to it by
Customer. Customer will be entitled to this information once in any
twelve (12) calendar month period, except if and when required by the
instruction of a competent data protection authority. The Customer
agrees that these reports and other documentation will be used as the
primary and only mechanism to audit and inspect GoodData’s processing
activities, unless Customer is required to perform an on-site audit by
the applicable data protection authority, or if GoodData materially
fails to comply with GDPR negatively impacting Customer’s Data. In the
event that Customer requires an on-site audit of the procedures relevant
to the protection of Customer Personal Data, then such audits requested
must meet the following requirements:</p>
<p>2.12.1 Any audit must be requested with at least one month's notice and
include a detailed audit plan that describes the proposed scope,
duration, reimbursement rates, and start date of the audit which the
parties must mutually agree upon prior to the commencement of an audit.
Audit requests must be sent to
<a href="mailto:security@gooddata.com">security@gooddata.com</a>.</p>
<p>2.12.2  The auditor must execute a written GoodData-form confidentiality
agreement prior to conducting the audit.</p>
<p>2.12.3  The audit must be conducted during regular business hours,
subject to GoodData’s policies, and may not unreasonably interfere with
GoodData's business activities.</p>
<p>2.12.4 Customer will reimburse GoodData for any time expended at its
then-current reasonable professional services and support rates, made
available to Customer upon request. All reimbursement rates will be
reasonable and take into account the resources expended by GoodData.</p>
<p>2.12.5 For all audits, Customer must immediately notify GoodData with
information regarding any suspected or actual non-compliance revealed
during an audit.  Any information resulting or derived from any audit
under this Section 2.12 including any Customer analyses, notes,
assessments or other materials in whatever form or media constitute
GoodData Confidential Information subject to applicable protections
defined in the Agreement.</p>
<p>2.13 <em>General cooperation to remediate</em>: In the event that Applicable
Data Protection Law, or a data protection authority or regulator,
provides that the transfer or processing of Personal Data under this
Addendum is no longer lawful or otherwise permitted, then the Parties
shall agree to remediate the processing (by amendment to this Addendum
or otherwise) in order to meet the necessary standards or requirements.
If GoodData is unable to remediate the processing within the applicable
cure period set forth in the Agreement, then Customer will be entitled
to terminate the Agreement (and any other agreement between the Parties
relating to the provision of services by GoodData to Customer) in
accordance with Section 11 (or Termination provision) of the Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>3. TERM</strong></p>
<p>3.1 The obligations placed upon the GoodData under this Addendum shall
survive so long as GoodData and/or its sub-Processors process Personal
Data on behalf of Customer.</p>

<h3>ANNEX A</h3>
<h3>Standard Contractual Clauses</h3>
<p></p>
<p>For the purposes of Article 26(2) of Directive 95/46/EC for the transfer
of personal data to processors established in third countries which do
not ensure an adequate level of data protection, the entity identified
as “<strong>You</strong>” in the Agreement (referred to herein as &quot;<strong>Customer</strong>&quot; or
“<strong>the data exporter</strong>”) and <strong>GoodData Corporation</strong> (referred to
herein as “<strong>GoodData</strong>” or “<strong>the data importer</strong>”) (each, a “party”;
together “the parties”) HAVE AGREED on the following Contractual Clauses
(the “Clauses”) in order to adduce adequate safeguards with respect to
the protection of privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of
individuals for the transfer by the data exporter to the data importer
of the personal data specified in Appendix 1.</p>
<p><strong>1. Definitions:</strong></p>
<p>For the purposes of the Clauses:<br>
<strong>'personal data', 'special categories of data', 'process/processing',
'controller', 'processor', 'data subject'</strong> and <strong>'supervisory
authority'</strong> shall have the same meaning as in the applicable data
protection law on the protection of individuals with regard to the
processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data.<br>
<strong>'the data exporter'</strong> means the controller who transfers the personal
data.<br>
<strong>'the data importer'</strong> means the processor who agrees to receive from
the data exporter personal data intended for processing on his behalf
after the transfer in accordance with his instructions and the terms of
the Clauses and who is not subject to a third country's system ensuring
adequate protection within the meaning of Article 25(1) of Directive
95/46/EC.<br>
<strong>'the subprocessor'</strong> means any processor engaged by the data importer
or by any other subprocessor of the data importer who agrees to receive
from the data importer or from any other subprocessor of the data
importer personal data exclusively intended for processing activities to
be carried out on behalf of the data exporter after the transfer in
accordance with his instructions, the terms of the Clauses and the terms
of the written subcontract.<br>
<strong>'the applicable data protection law'</strong> means the legislation
protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals and, in
particular, their right to privacy with respect to the processing of
personal data applicable to a data controller in the Member State in
which the data exporter is established.<br>
<strong>'technical and organizational security measures'</strong> means those
measures aimed at protecting personal data against accidental or
unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized
disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the
transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful
forms of processing.</p>
<p><strong>2. Details of the transfer</strong></p>
<p>The details of the transfer and in particular the special categories of
personal data where applicable are specified in Appendix 1 which forms
an integral part of the Clauses.</p>
<p><strong>3. Third-party beneficiary clause</strong></p>
<p>3.1  The data subject can enforce against the data exporter this Clause,
Clause 4(b) to (i), Clause 5(a) to (e), and (g) to (j), Clause 6(1) and
(2), Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12 as third-party
beneficiary.</p>
<p>3.2  The data subject can enforce against the data importer this Clause,
Clause 5(a) to (e) and (g), Clause 6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses
9 to 12, in cases where the data exporter has factually disappeared or
has ceased to exist in law unless any successor entity has assumed the
entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by
operation of law, as a result of which it takes on the rights and
obligations of the data exporter, in which case the data subject can
enforce them against such entity.</p>
<p>3.3  The data subject can enforce against the subprocessor this Clause,
Clause 5(a) to (e) and (g), Clause 6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses
9 to 12, in cases where both the data exporter and the data importer
have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become
insolvent, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal
obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law as a
result of which it takes on the rights and obligations of the data
exporter, in which case the data subject can enforce them against such
entity. Such third-party liability of the subprocessor shall be limited
to its own processing operations under the Clauses.</p>
<p>3.4 The parties do not object to a data subject being represented by an
association or other body if the data subject so expressly wishes and if
permitted by national law.</p>
<p><strong>4. Obligations of the data exporter</strong></p>
<p>The data exporter agrees and warrants:</p>
<p>​(a)  that the processing, including the transfer itself, of the
personal data has been and will continue to be carried out in accordance

respect of the technical and organizational security measures specified
in Appendix 2 to this contract;</p>
<p>​(d)  that after assessment of the requirements of the applicable data
protection law, the security measures are appropriate to protect
personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental
loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, in particular where
the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and
against all other unlawful forms of processing, and that these measures
ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks presented by the
processing and the nature of the data to be protected having regard to
the state of the art and the cost of their implementation;</p>
<p>​(e)  that it will ensure compliance with the security measures;</p>
<p>​(f)  that, if the transfer involves special categories of data, the
data subject has been informed or will be informed before, or as soon as
possible after, the transfer that its data could be transmitted to a
third country not providing adequate protection within the meaning of
Directive 95/46/EC;</p>
<p>​(g)  to forward any notification received from the data importer or any
subprocessor pursuant to Clause 5(b) and Clause 8(3) to the data

promptly the data exporter of its inability to comply, in which case the
data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or
terminate the contract;</p>
<p>​(b)  that it has no reason to believe that the legislation applicable
to it prevents it from fulfilling the instructions received from the
data exporter and its obligations under the contract and that in the
event of a change in this legislation which is likely to have a
substantial adverse effect on the warranties and obligations provided by
the Clauses, it will promptly notify the change to the data exporter as
soon as it is aware, in which case the data exporter is entitled to
suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract;</p>
<p>​(c) that it has implemented the technical and organizational security
measures specified in Appendix 2 before processing the personal data
transferred;</p>
<p>​(d)  that it will promptly notify the data exporter about:</p>

shall be replaced by a summary description of the security measures in
those cases where the data subject is unable to obtain a copy from the
data exporter;</p>
<p>​(h)  that, in the event of subprocessing, it has previously informed

<p><strong>6. Liability</strong></p>
<p>6.1  The parties agree that any data subject, who has suffered damage as
a result of any breach of the obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in
Clause 11 by any party or subprocessor is entitled to receive
compensation from the data exporter for the damage suffered.</p>
<p>6.2  If a data subject is not able to bring a claim for compensation in
accordance with paragraph 6.1 against the data exporter, arising out of
a breach by the data importer or his subprocessor of any of their
obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11, because the data
exporter has factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or has
become insolvent, the data importer agrees that the data subject may
issue a claim against the data importer as if it were the data exporter,
unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of
the data exporter by contract or by operation of law, in which case the
data subject can enforce its rights against such entity.</p>
<p>6.3  The data importer may not rely on a breach by a subprocessor of its
obligations in order to avoid its own liabilities.</p>
<p>6.4  If a data subject is not able to bring a claim against the data
exporter or the data importer referred to in paragraphs 6.1 and 6.2,
arising out of a breach by the subprocessor of any of their obligations
referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 because both the data exporter
and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in
law or have become insolvent, the subprocessor agrees that the data
subject may issue a claim against the data subprocessor with regard to
its own processing operations under the Clauses as if it were the data
exporter or the data importer, unless any successor entity has assumed
the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by
contract or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can
enforce its rights against such entity. The liability of the
subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the
Clauses.</p>
<p><strong>7. Mediation and jurisdiction</strong></p>
<p>7.1 The data importer agrees that if the data subject invokes against it
third-party beneficiary rights and/or claims compensation for damages
under the Clauses, the data importer will accept the decision of the
data subject:</p>
<p>​(a)  to refer the dispute to mediation, by an independent person or,

<p>8.1  The data exporter agrees to deposit a copy of this contract with
the supervisory authority if it so requests or if such deposit is
required under the applicable data protection law.</p>
<p>8.2  The parties agree that the supervisory authority has the right to
conduct an audit of the data importer, and of any subprocessor, which
has the same scope and is subject to the same conditions as would apply
to an audit of the data exporter under the applicable data protection
law.</p>
<p>8.3  The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter about the
existence of legislation applicable to it or any subprocessor preventing
the conduct of an audit of the data importer, or any subprocessor,
pursuant to paragraph 8.2. In such a case the data exporter shall be
entitled to take the measures foreseen in Clause 5 (b).</p>
<p><strong>9. Governing Law</strong></p>
<p>The Clauses shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which
the data exporter is established, namely ___________.</p>
<p><strong>10. Variation of the contract</strong></p>
<p>The parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses. This does not
preclude the parties from adding clauses on business related issues
where required as long as they do not contradict the Clause.</p>
<p><strong>11. Subprocessing</strong></p>
<p>11.1  The data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing
operations performed on behalf of the data exporter under the Clauses
without the prior written consent of the data exporter. Where the data
importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the
consent of the data exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written
agreement with the subprocessor which imposes the same obligations on
the subprocessor as are imposed on the data importer under the Clauses.
Where the subprocessor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations
under such written agreement the data importer shall remain fully liable
to the data exporter for the performance of the subprocessor's
obligations under such agreement.</p>
<p>11.2  The prior written contract between the data importer and the
subprocessor shall also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause as
laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data subject is not able to
bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6
against the data exporter or the data importer because they have
factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have become
insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal
obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by
operation of law. Such third-party liability of the subprocessor shall
be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.</p>
<p>11.3  The provisions relating to data protection aspects for
subprocessing of the contract referred to in paragraph 11.1 shall be
governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is
established, namely ___________.</p>
<p>11.4  The data exporter shall keep a list of subprocessing agreements
concluded under the Clauses and notified by the data importer pursuant
to Clause 5 (j), which shall be updated at least once a year. The list
shall be available to the data exporter's data protection supervisory
authority.</p>
<p><strong>12. Obligation after the termination of personal data processing
services</strong></p>
<p>12.1  The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data
processing services, the data importer and the subprocessor shall, at
the choice of the data exporter, return all the personal data
transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or shall destroy
all the personal data and certify to the data exporter that it has done
so, unless legislation imposed upon the data importer prevents it from
returning or destroying all or part of the personal data transferred. In
that case, the data importer warrants that it will guarantee the
confidentiality of the personal data transferred and will not actively
process the personal data transferred anymore.</p>
<p>12.2  The data importer and the subprocessor warrant that upon request
of the data exporter and/or of the supervisory authority, it will submit
its data processing facilities for an audit of the measures referred to
in paragraph 12.1.</p>
